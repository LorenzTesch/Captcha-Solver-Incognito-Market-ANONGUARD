This script is able to provide the correct solution to it automatically.\
It must be executed on the page, when the captcha is visible.\

Canvases must be enabled. Tor blocks them by default. Go to 'about:config', and set privacy.resistFingerprinting.autoDeclineNoUserInputCanvasPrompts to false.\
The challenges might need multiple solvings.
